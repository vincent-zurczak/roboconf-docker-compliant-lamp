A Docker compliant version of Roboconf's LAMP sample.  
The graph is complete. Any variable changed in the graph or the instances will be injected in the configuration files.

Once deployed, find the IP address of the Apache load balancer (e.g. 172.17.0.19).  
Then, open your web browser to http://172.17.0.19/roboconf-hello/.
